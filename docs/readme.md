# Quazzu DEMO
## Built from a tutorial from [Traversy Media](https://www.traversymedia.com/)

This was a fun tutorial I plan on using as part of my portfolio of work. I built this following along with a Youtube Video Mid 2018. I plan on expanding on this project and rebuilding this site using Vue or React at some point in 2019. Design and Code are MIT as of the tutorial date.
